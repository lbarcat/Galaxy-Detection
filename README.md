The Galaxy Detection algorithm is responsible for classifying and revealing data about several galaxies, using some astrophotography for analysis. The model is trained using deep learning techniques to improve classification accuracy. I'm working on a first version, classifying each type of galaxy and improving the model with more data.

In machine learning, training a model refers to the process of training a model with a large dataset to learn the underlying patterns and relationships between the input and output data. The aim is to adjust the model's parameters so that it can predict the output accurately for unseen input data.

In contrast, inference refers to the process of using the trained model to make predictions on new, unseen data. The trained model uses the learned patterns to make predictions on new input data.

The main difference between the two is that training involves the process of optimizing the model's parameters to make accurate predictions while inference involves applying the trained model to new data to generate predictions. During training, the model is adjusted to minimize the error between the predicted output and the actual output. On the other hand, during inference, the trained model takes in the new data and produces a prediction based on the learned patterns from the training process.

In summary, training a model involves adjusting the parameters of the model to make accurate predictions while inference involves applying the trained model to new data to generate predictions based on the learned patterns.
